Managers in wonder as Lionel Messi breaks La Liga goal-scoring record

Barcelona boss Luis Enrique and his counterpart, Sevilla's Unai Emery were united in their praise of Leo Messi after the Argentine star broke the La Liga goal-scoring record on Saturday.

Speaking after Barca's 5-1 romp over Sevilla, Enrique told reporters that he had no doubt that the 27-year-old was the best player to have ever graced the game.

"There are plenty of Messi goals that I like. For years I've said I've not seen a player like this. He is unmatched by any player I've ever seen," said the manager.

"He will be a unique and unrepeatable player. Now we have him and we enjoy him. I thought no one would beat [Telmo] Zarra and look...

"I like to live in the present and it is wonderful. For me Messi is the best player ever.

"There's no controversy. Messi knows the fans hold him very dear. He feels very comfortable here."

Rival coach Emery echoed the Barca manager's sentiments, saying that the Sevillistas were merely bystanders to the Messi show.

"We didn't want to be the guests to his party, but we have been. Today's result is humbling," Football ESPANA quotes Emery as saying.

"Sometimes we can't control our positivity. Maybe this will come in handy to balance the mood. For my part, I try to maintain a balance. After this defeat I want to raise the spirits to play Feyenoord [on Thursday].

"We competed well defensively in the first 45 minutes but didn't accompany that with the attacking side.

"We competed well regardless of the lack of a goal but in the second half we lost the freshness in defence."

Barca captain Xavi Hernandez also spoke to the media after the game, express his happiness for his long-time teammate.

"We're happy about everything, for Leo, it's an incredible record, historic, and he deserves it as a person and as a player."
